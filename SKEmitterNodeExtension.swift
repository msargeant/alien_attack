// .sks files are archived in SKEmitterNode instances. Our property changes in the Xcode particle editor actually changes real properties on this kind of node.

// We will need to retireve a copy of that node by loading it from the app bundle. In order to mimic the api that apple uses for sound actions, we will build a Swift extension to add a new method to the SKEmitterNode class to  unarchive our .sks file.

// This was called a category in Objective-C, but is called an extension in Swift.

// Use a Swift extension to extend the string class to have our own defined length property.
